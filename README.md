# Stock Market Prediction Web App
This project aims to create a web app that predicts and visualizes the stock market trends for various companies using a 50-day moving average. The app uses a sequential model with Dense, Dropout, and LSTM layers to achieve high accuracy. The model is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas_datareader, plotly.express, streamlit, requests, streamlit_lottie, keras.models, and tensorflow. The app allows users to select different companies and stocks and compare the real and predicted graphs. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning and data visualization techniques to financial data analysis.
